# TODO

* Redo NPDA.
* Flexible predictor protocol?
* Allow extension of rules?
* Parser NDFA. This will be a huge performance win. See 'Practical Earley Parsing',
Aycock & Horspool 2002, to see the performance compares favorably to standard automata.
* Also test reliable disambiguity (LR vs LL in particular) when the above is implemented.
