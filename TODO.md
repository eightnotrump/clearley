# TODO

Alpha:

* Flesh out defrule unit tests.
* Less verbose tokenization and character classes. Top-down tokenizers.

Beta: 

* JSON example.
* Clean up the software internals.
* Work on defrule syntax. Eventually I want to make Clearley self-hosting, as a POC.

Release:

* Parser NDFA.
* Also test reliable disambiguity (LR vs LL in particular) when the above is implemented.
