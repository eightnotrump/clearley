# Clearley

A flexible, programmable parser library in Clojure.

## Crash course

Clearley is a context-free grammar parser. The goal of Clearley is to be
a general way to process any stream of incoming data. Clearley will accept
any context-free grammar, and most real-world use cases run in O(n) time.

Here is Clearley in action, defining a simple calculator parser.

Here's the calculator in action.

You can see more examples in the `test/examples` folder. There's a JSON parser there,
for instance.

## Defrule

Clearley provides a macro library for writing DSLs in Clojure

The main construct is defrule, which takes a rule name, a rule body,
and an action body. You can grab a parse tree if you want, but Clearley is designed
also to make it easy to process the parse tree. Here's how you grab a parse tree:

Each rule is associated with a parse action, which is a function. When a rule
is parsed successfully, Clearley can call a parse action. The parse action takes
as its arguments, in order, the results of the parse actions of the child rules.
In the above calculator example, the parse actions are pretty simple;
the construct `` tells Clearley whenever we encounter something of the form
``, we call `(+ )`. Parse actions can be as simple or complex as you wish.
This is deferred until after parse time, so you can also think of it as crawling
the parse tree, executing parse actions recrusively from the top down.

Keywords can be used as rule names, and they map naturally to action bodies.

qualified keywords also (they become dequalified in action bodies in defrule):

Defrule lets you bind multiple rules to one clause:

inline rules:

and inline multiple rules:

## Functional API

Macros are a convenience layer for functions, not a substitute for them.
Everything in Clearley can be done with functions, which are exposed to the user.
These are described in the docs. However, beware: Clearley is still in dev
and the functional API may change.
