; Tools for CLR(1) grammars.

; The core abstractions are items and item sets.
; An item is a rule we're trying to match, and might want to match some sequence
; or choice of subrules. They are usually represented as dotted CFG rules:
; rule -> subrule1 â€¢ subrule2, signifying an rule that's matched subrule1
; and wants to match subrule2. An rule is said to be 'complete' if it has
; no more subrules to match.

; Items can have lookahead. For a complete item,
; an item to be 'complete with lookahead'
; means that it doesn't count as complete unless the next token in the input
; matches the lookahead. This is very useful for avoiding so-called 'shift reduce'
; conflicts, which are performance issues even in nondeterministic parsers.
; In particular, 'zero or more' items,
; like something that matches zero or more spaces,
; can decide whether it's complete or not based on whether a space is
; in the next input.

; An item set is a set of unique items, together with 'backlinks'
; recording item dependencies. An item 'predicts' subrules. If we have
; rule1 -> subrule1, this item can 'predict' subrule1 and subrule1 is added
; and 'backlinked' to rule1.

; A rule is 'nullable' if it can match the empty string. An item can be 'eager
; advanced' if one of its predicted subrules is nullable.

; === Item record ===
; name: an object representing the clause that predicted this item
; should have a short str representation
; rule: the rule for this item
; backlink: the rule from the original item set, before shifts
; (but including initial eager advances)
; match-count: the number of times this rule has been scanned or advanced
; follow: a terminal that can follow this item
; (depends on predicting items)
